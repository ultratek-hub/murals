# 🧩 ULTRATEK Overlays

This repo contains symbolic overlays, QR logic, and zone mapping tools used across ULTRATEK’s murals, signs, and digital infrastructure. These files bridge physical glyphs with digital interactivity—supporting remix, onboarding, and campus expansion.

## 🔷 What Are Overlays?

Overlays are modular visual fragments that:
- Map glyphs to physical zones
- Guide QR code placement on murals and signs
- Highlight symbolic ambassador roles
- Enable remixable wall sections for workshops and expansion

They’re used by mural planners, digital designers, and collaborators remixing ULTRATEK’s symbolic system.

## 🛠 Remix Workflow

1. Choose glyphs from `murals/symbols/`
2. Reference zone or ambient meaning from `.md` files
3. Use overlays to position QR codes or symbolic fragments
4. Remix into new murals, signs, or digital pages
