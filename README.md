# ULTRATEK Murals

This repo documents ULTRATEK’s symbolic mural system—designed for remixability, clarity, and campus movement.

## 🔷 What’s Inside

- Symbol dictionary and zone mappings
- Elevation overlays and geometry logic
- Painter install guides and registration marks

## 🧠 Symbolic System

Each glyph represents a zone, concept, or role. The mural acts as a map, onboarding tool, and symbolic interface.
